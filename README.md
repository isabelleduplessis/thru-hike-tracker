# Thru-Hike Tracker

(Still in progress) 

Thru-Hike Tracker is an app designed to allow thru-hikers to track their hikes, view statistics based on daily mileage entries, keep a journal, and update friends and family along the way. Existing hike-tracking apps do not allow users to keep track of on-trail vs off-trail miles, alternate routes, or skips, but Thru-Hike Tracker will allow users to continue accurately documenting their hike, even when things don't go as planned.
