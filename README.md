# Thru-Hike Tracker

(Still in progress, to be completed by the 2025 hiking season) 

Thru-Hike Tracker is an app designed to allow thru-hikers to track their hikes, view statistics based on daily mileage entries, keep a journal, and update friends and family along the way. Existing hike-tracking apps do not allow users to keep track of on-trail vs off-trail miles, alternate routes, or skips, but Thru-Hike Tracker will allow users to accurately document their hike even when things don't go as planned.


Run script:

## Future Plans

- Allow users to enter custom routes for trails with many alternate options (Continental Divide Trail) or newly created routes
- Use existing data to predict hike timeline based on user mileage and date, allowing users to let people know when they anticipate reaching a certain destination
- Create option to attach photos to daily entries
- Create a calendar visual displaying daily mileage
- Connect with Strava API for those who track their hike with GPS to incorporate more stats into analysis
- Add options for daily entries of wildlife sightings, camp location, people encountered, etc.
- Add feedback option
